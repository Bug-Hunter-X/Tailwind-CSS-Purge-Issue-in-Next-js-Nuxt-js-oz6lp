This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js, where the CSS isn't applied correctly to your components.  This often happens because Tailwind's purge mechanism is not configured properly, leading to classes being removed that are actually being used in your components.  The error might not produce a visible error message but instead simply result in styles not being applied. For example, a button might not have any styling applied, even though you've added the necessary Tailwind classes.
