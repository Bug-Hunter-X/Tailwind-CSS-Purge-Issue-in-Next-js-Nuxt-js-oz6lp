# Tailwind CSS Purge Issue in Next.js/Nuxt.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS's purge mechanism fails to correctly identify and include all necessary styles in a Next.js/Nuxt.js application. The issue results in missing styles or unexpected rendering.

## Bug Description
Styles defined in your Tailwind CSS configuration are not being applied to components, despite using correct class names. The application might render components without any styling or with partially applied styles, leading to inconsistent visual results. This is usually due to incorrect configuration of Tailwind's purge settings, causing it to remove classes that are actually in use.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server.
4. Observe the missing or partially applied styles in the UI components.

## Solution
The solution involves correctly configuring the purge option in your Tailwind CSS configuration to ensure all necessary classes are included. This is often done by specifying the content paths where Tailwind should search for used classes.   Incorrectly configured `purge` options will lead to unexpected behavior.
