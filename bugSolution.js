The problem is likely due to an incorrectly configured purge option in your Tailwind CSS configuration. The purge option needs to be updated to accurately identify and preserve the necessary classes. 

**Incorrect Configuration (bug.js):**
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

**Corrected Configuration (bugSolution.js):**
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ['./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
By updating `content` to include the directories containing your components and pages, Tailwind can correctly identify the used classes and prevent them from being purged.
